                <p>Individual reactions to the color black can vary widely. According to German scientist Hermann von Helmholz, "Black is real sensation, even if it is produced by the entire absence of light. The sensation of black is distinctly different from the lack of all sensation.</p>

                    <h3>Positive Associations with Black</h3>
                </header>
                <p>For some, black evokes positive associations with this color, including attractiveness and elegance.1

                    ﻿ The color oozes sophistication. That’s why so many people choose to don black clothing when attending a fancy event. It’s also why high-end brands like Tiffany & Co. and Chanel utilize black in their logos.2﻿
                    
                    When it comes to high society, the color black has long been associated with power. From priests to judges, tuxedos to credit cards. And let’s not forget about Steve Jobs.</p>

                    <h3>Negative associations with Black</h3>
                </headers>
                <p>However, many use the color black to symbolize all things negative. Throughout history, this somber color has been tied to death and all things evil and bad. It evokes strong feelings of anger, aggression, fear, and sadness.3﻿

                    The connection between black and negativity is probably most clearly seen in our language. Just consider these commonly used expressions: Black Monday. Black Plague. Black magic. Blackball. Blackhole. Black-hearted. Black mood. Black sheep. Blackmail. Black market. Blackout. The list could go on.
                    And nothing says "bad guy" quite like the color black. Though black is worn (and often preferred) by people from all walks of society,4﻿ it's often seen as the stereotypical color for criminals and villains.5﻿ Why do you think the color of choice for villains (think Dracula and Darth Vader) and other shady movie and TV show characters is almost always black?

                    Choose black for your kids' room to bring calm and creativity.
                    If you have a home office in the north part of your house, paint one wall black.
                    Paint the floor black in a room in the north part of your space.
                    Try black and white in your laundry room or kitchen.
                    Try placing black accessories like knick-knacks, frames, or vases around your home.
