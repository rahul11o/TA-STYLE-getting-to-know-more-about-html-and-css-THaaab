                <p>In color psychology, red provokes the strongest emotions of any color. While cool colors like green and blue are generally considered peaceful and calming, red is considered the warmest and most contradictory of the colors. In fact, this fiery hue has more opposing emotional associations than any other color: Red is linked to passion and love as well as power and anger</p>

                    <h3>Danger and Warning</h3>
                </header>
                <P>Thanks to its long wavelength, red is one of the most visible colors in the color spectrum (second only to yellow). Its ability to instantly grab people's attention is the reason why it's often used to warn people of impending danger. Think: stop signs, sirens, fire engines, and red traffic lights.

                    Red is also used to convey danger in a non-literal way. Some examples include using the phrase "in the red" to describe financial loss or "red flag" to indicate when something is wrong with a person or situation.
                    
                    People tend to associate red with negative, danger-bearing emotions. This could be because it is the color of fire, blood, and sometimes of poisonous or dangerous animals.</P>

                </headers>
                <p>This stimulating color is also associated with excitement.

                    Studies show that being exposed to or wearing red can cause some of the following physical effects:-<br>
                    
                    
                   1. Elevated blood pressure 
                   2. Enhanced metabolism
                   3. Increased heart rate
                   4.Increased respiration rate <br>
                    
                    All of these physiological changes naturally cause your energy levels to spike.
                    
                    The color is also known to increase your appetite by increasing your metabolism, which is why red is such a popular color in restaurants.</p>

                    <h3>Dominance</h3>
                </header>
                <p>It's not just mood and emotions that the color red can affect. In the arena of sports, wearing the color red can also increase your chances of winning.

                    In the 2004 Olympics in Athens, competitors in four sports—boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, freestyle wrestling, and taekwondo—were randomly assigned red or blue clothing. In all four competitions, red-clad contestants won more fights.6﻿
                    
                    Many think these results are due to the link between red and perceived dominance. For instance, donning a red uniform may cause an athlete to feel dominant and perform more aggressively. Alternatively, athletes in red may be seen as more aggressive, more dominant, and more likely to win a physical competition not only by their opponents but also by the referees.7
                    
                    ﻿
                    
                    Whatever the reason, it is clear that red-clad athletes tend to have a significant advantage over their opponents. (Maybe this is why so many athletes, including the great Tiger Woods, wear red clothing when they compete.)</p>
